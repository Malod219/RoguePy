# RoguePy
A generic Roguelike

Following this tutorial for the creation of it, and deviating from it where I feel it's necessary.

## My intentions
My intentions with this as I have finished the tutorial is to continue developing upon it. The following in this list are a set of features I wish to implement.
- [] Randomly generated dungeon history or world history.
- [] Room theming
- [] More forms of level procedural generation
- [] More equipment and items
- [] Item identification syste,
- [] Level ups as mutations instead of straight stat boosts
- [] Mouse interaction
- [] Ranged weapons
- [] Tinkering system
- [] Gameplay loop(I'm thinking of space ship or overworld traders at a location - > Dungeoneering a dungeon with X floors and Y theme).
- [] Proper Equipment system
